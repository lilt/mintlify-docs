</ParamField>

## Usage Instructions

### Preparing Your Figma Files

1. **Create Language Versions**: For each target language, create a duplicate of your source page
2. **Naming Convention**: Include the target language in the page name (e.g., "Homepage - ES", "Homepage - FR")
3. **Organize Pages**: Group related language versions together for easier management

### Submitting Translation Requests

1. **Select Target Page**: Choose the target language page you want to translate
2. **Launch Plugin**: Go to **Plugins** → **LILT ↔ Figma Connector Plugin**
3. **Configure Translation**:
   - Select **Translation Type**: Instant or Verified
   - Choose **Source Language**: Language of your original design
   - Choose **Target Language**: Language for translation
   - Select **Memory** (optional): Choose a specific translation memory if configured
4. **Submit Request**: Click **Submit** to send content for translation

### Importing Completed Translations

1. **Check Status**: Click the **Status** icon in the plugin's bottom bar
2. **Monitor Progress**: Translation jobs will show as "In Progress" until completed
3. **Import Translations**: 
   - When status changes to "Delivered", navigate to the target language page
   - Click on the **Orders** tab in the plugin
   - Select delivered orders and click **Import**
   - The plugin will automatically update text elements with translations

## Best Practices

### Design Preparation

- Use consistent text styles and components across your designs
- Organize text elements in logical groups for easier translation management
- Consider text expansion when designing UI elements (some languages require more space)
- Use descriptive names for text layers to provide context for translators

### File Organization

- Create a clear folder structure for different language versions
- Use consistent naming conventions across all language variants
- Group related pages together (e.g., all onboarding screens for each language)
- Maintain a master source file that serves as the reference for all translations

### Translation Workflow

- Start with high-priority or frequently updated content
- Use Instant translation for rapid prototyping and Verified for final designs
- Coordinate with your LILT Production Strategist for memory setup and optimization
- Review translations in context within your design layouts

### Quality Control

- Review translated text for proper fit within UI elements
- Check for text truncation or overflow issues
- Verify that translated content maintains the intended user experience
- Test interactive prototypes with translated content

## Advanced Features

### Memory Management

Work with your LILT Production Strategist to:
- Set up project-specific translation memories
- Maintain consistency across different design projects
- Leverage previously translated content for efficiency

### Batch Processing

For large design systems:
- Process multiple pages or components simultaneously
- Use consistent translation settings across related content
- Coordinate translation timing with design development cycles

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Issues

**Issue**: Plugin not loading or appearing in Figma
- **Solution**: Refresh your browser and try reloading the plugin
- **Solution**: Check that you're logged into the correct Figma account
- **Solution**: Verify plugin installation in your Figma Community plugins

**Issue**: Authentication errors
- **Solution**: Verify your LILT token is entered correctly without extra spaces
- **Solution**: Check that the API URL is exactly `https://lilt.com/2`
- **Solution**: Contact your LILT team to verify token validity

### Translation Issues

**Issue**: Content not submitting for translation
- **Solution**: Ensure you have text elements selected in your design
- **Solution**: Check that source and target languages are different
- **Solution**: Verify you have the necessary permissions for the Figma file

**Issue**: Translations not importing correctly
- **Solution**: Ensure you're on the correct target language page
- **Solution**: Check that the translation job status shows as "Delivered"
- **Solution**: Verify that text elements exist and are editable

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Plugin running slowly
- **Solution**: Close other Figma plugins that might be running
- **Solution**: Reduce the number of text elements being processed at once
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection stability

## FAQ

**Q: How do I handle text that doesn't fit after translation?**
A: Review designs after translation import and adjust text box sizes, font sizes, or layout as needed. Consider text expansion during initial design.

**Q: Can I use the plugin for right-to-left languages?**
A: Yes, but you may need to manually adjust text alignment and layout direction in Figma after importing translations.

**Q: What file formats work with the Figma connector?**
A: The connector works directly with Figma files and text elements. It doesn't require file export/import.

**Q: How do I track translation progress?**
A: Use the Status feature in the plugin to monitor job progress. You can also coordinate with your LILT Production Strategist for project updates.

**Q: Can I translate prototype interactions and micro-copy?**
A: Yes, any text element in your Figma file can be translated, including button labels, tooltips, and interaction text.

**Q: Is there a limit to how much content I can translate?**
A: Limits depend on your LILT account configuration. Contact your Account Executive for details about your specific limits.

**Q: How do I maintain consistency across different design files?**
A: Use translation memories and coordinate with your LILT Production Strategist to maintain terminology consistency across projects.
