## Overview

The AWS WorkDocs connector enables you to sync and manage translation files between your AWS WorkDocs drive and LILT platform. This connector provides automated translation workflows for your document management system, making it easy to collaborate on multilingual content while maintaining your existing WorkDocs structure and permissions.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the AWS WorkDocs connector, ensure you have:

- AWS account with WorkDocs enabled
- AWS IAM user with appropriate WorkDocs permissions
- Access to AWS Management Console
- Files in supported formats (see [supported file types](/guides/supported-formats))
- Proper permissions to access and modify folders in WorkDocs

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure AWS IAM

1. **Create IAM User**
   - Navigate to AWS IAM Console
   - Create a new user for LILT connector access
   - Generate Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

2. **Assign WorkDocs Permissions**
   - Attach the `AmazonWorkDocsFullAccess` policy
   - Or create a custom policy with specific WorkDocs permissions:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "workdocs:GetDocument",
             "workdocs:GetDocumentVersion",
             "workdocs:UpdateDocument",
             "workdocs:CreateFolder",
             "workdocs:GetFolder",
             "workdocs:UpdateFolder"
           ],
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### Step 2: Get WorkDocs Organization ID

1. **Access WorkDocs Console**
   - Navigate to AWS WorkDocs in the Management Console
   - Select your WorkDocs site

2. **Find Organization ID**
   - Go to **Settings** → **General**
   - Copy the Organization ID value

### Step 3: Configure LILT Connector

1. **Add Connector in LILT**
   - Navigate to Settings → Connectors in LILT
   - Select "AWS WorkDocs" from the available connectors

2. **Enter Configuration**
   - Input all required parameters from steps above
   - Test the connection to ensure proper authentication

3. **Set Up Folder Structure**
   - Configure source and destination folder paths
   - Ensure proper access permissions for the specified folders

## Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Environment Setup

For organizations with multiple environments (dev, staging, production):

```yaml
environments:
  production:
    aws_region: "us-east-1"
    organization_id: "d-1234567890"
    rclone_backend_path: "/production-content/"
  staging:
    aws_region: "us-west-2"
    organization_id: "d-0987654321"
    rclone_backend_path: "/staging-content/"
```

### Content Type Filtering

Configure specific document types for translation:

<ParamField path="supported_file_types" type="array" optional>
  Array of file extensions to process (e.g., `[".docx", ".pdf", ".xlsx"]`)
</ParamField>

## Best Practices

### Security
- Store AWS credentials securely using LILT's secret management system
- Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Regularly rotate access keys
- Enable CloudTrail logging for audit purposes

### Performance
- Organize content in logical folder structures
- Use file filtering to process only necessary documents
- Monitor AWS WorkDocs API limits and usage
- Consider file size limits for optimal processing

### Collaboration
- Set up shared folders for team collaboration
- Use WorkDocs comments and annotations for translation feedback
- Maintain version control through WorkDocs versioning
- Configure proper user permissions for translators

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
- Verify AWS credentials are correct and not expired
- Check IAM permissions for WorkDocs access
- Ensure the specified region matches your WorkDocs deployment

**File Access Issues**
- Confirm folder paths exist in WorkDocs
- Verify user permissions for specified folders
- Check that files are not locked or being edited by other users

**Sync Problems**
- Validate file formats are supported
- Check network connectivity to AWS services
- Review file size limitations
- Ensure sufficient storage space in WorkDocs
