4. Navigate to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**

### Step 2: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Click **Create Credentials** → **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
2. Configure the consent screen if prompted
3. Select **Web application** as the application type
4. Add authorized redirect URIs:

4. Grant the service account **Content Manager** permissions
5. Create and download a JSON key file (optional for advanced setups)

### Step 4: Generate Refresh Token

1. Visit the [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground)
2. Click the settings gear icon and check **Use your own OAuth credentials**
3. Enter your Client ID and Client Secret
4. In the left panel, select **Drive API v3** and choose:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
5. Click **Authorize APIs** and complete the OAuth flow
6. Click **Exchange authorization code for tokens**
7. Copy the **Refresh Token** for your connector configuration

### Step 5: Set Up Shared Drive

1. Create a new Shared Drive in Google Drive or use an existing one
2. Share the Shared Drive with your service account email
3. Grant the service account **Content Manager** permissions
4. Create the folder structure you want LILT to use
5. Copy the Team Drive ID from the URL when viewing the Shared Drive

### Step 6: Configure the Connector

1. In LILT, navigate to **Connectors** → **New Connector**
2. Select **Google Drive** from the connector list
3. Fill in the configuration parameters:

   - **Team Drive ID**: From Step 5
   - **Folder Path**: Full path from Shared Drive root

### Step 7: Test the Connection

1. Click **Validate** to test your configuration
2. The connector will verify:
   - Authentication credentials
   - Drive access permissions
   - Folder path validity

## Advanced Configuration

### File Filtering

Control which files are processed:

```yaml
# Include only specific document types
rclone_includes:
  - "**/*.docx"
  - "**/*.xlsx"
  - "**/*.json"
  - "**/*.xml"

# Exclude temporary and system files
rclone_excludes:
  - "**/temp/*"
  - "**/.DS_Store"
  - "**/~$*"
  - "**/*.tmp"
```

### Folder Organization

Organize your content with clear folder structure:

```
Team Drive Root/
├── Customer Folder/
│   ├── Production/
│   │   ├── Lilt/
│   │   │   ├── Source/
│   │   │   └── Translated/
│   │   └── Archive/
│   └── Review/
└── Templates/
```

## Best Practices

### File Organization

- Use a consistent folder structure in your Shared Drive
- Create separate folders for source and translated files
- Use descriptive folder names that include project or language information
- Implement an archive system for completed projects

### Security

- Use service accounts with minimal required permissions
- Regularly review and rotate OAuth credentials
- Enable two-factor authentication on Google accounts
- Monitor access logs through Google Admin Console

### Performance

- Use include/exclude patterns to limit file scanning scope
- Organize files in logical folder structures to improve sync performance
- Consider file size limits when working with large documents
- Use Google Drive's version control features for tracking changes

### Collaboration

- Set up proper sharing permissions for team members
- Use Google Drive's commenting and suggestion features for review workflows
- Implement naming conventions for files at different stages of translation
- Consider using Google Drive's approval workflows for quality control

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Error**: "Invalid credentials"
- **Solution**: Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- **Solution**: Ensure the OAuth consent screen is configured properly
- **Solution**: Check that the Google Drive API is enabled in your project

**Error**: "Refresh token expired"
- **Solution**: Generate a new refresh token using the OAuth Playground
- **Solution**: Ensure the refresh token was copied completely without truncation
- **Solution**: Check that the OAuth application has the correct scopes

### Drive Access Issues

**Error**: "Drive not found"
- **Solution**: Verify the Team Drive ID is correct
- **Solution**: Ensure the service account has been granted access to the Shared Drive
- **Solution**: Check that the Shared Drive hasn't been deleted or moved

**Error**: "Insufficient permissions"
- **Solution**: Grant the service account Content Manager permissions
- **Solution**: Verify the service account email is shared with the correct Shared Drive
- **Solution**: Check that the account has access to the specific folders in the path

### File Processing Issues

**Error**: "Folder path not found"
- **Solution**: Verify the folder path exists and is spelled correctly
- **Solution**: Ensure the path is relative to the Shared Drive root
- **Solution**: Check that folders in the path haven't been moved or deleted

**Issue**: Files not being imported
- **Solution**: Check your include/exclude patterns are not too restrictive
- **Solution**: Verify file formats are supported by LILT
- **Solution**: Ensure files are not corrupted or empty

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Slow synchronization
- **Solution**: Use more specific include patterns to reduce scanning scope
- **Solution**: Organize files in smaller, focused folders
- **Solution**: Check Google Drive API quota limits and usage

**Issue**: Large file processing problems
- **Solution**: Consider file size limits for your content type
- **Solution**: Break large files into smaller, manageable chunks
- **Solution**: Monitor Google Drive storage limits and usage

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use a personal Google account instead of Google Workspace?**
A: While technically possible, Google Workspace is recommended for better security, admin controls, and Shared Drive features.

**Q: What's the difference between a regular folder and a Shared Drive?**
A: Shared Drives provide better collaboration features, centralized ownership, and are recommended for team-based translation workflows.

**Q: How do I find my Team Drive ID?**
A: The Team Drive ID is visible in the URL when you're viewing the Shared Drive. It's the long string after `/folders/` in the URL.

**Q: Can I connect multiple Google Drives?**
A: Yes, you can set up multiple connectors for different Shared Drives or use different folder paths within the same Shared Drive.

**Q: What file formats are supported?**
A: The connector supports all file formats that LILT can process. See the [supported formats guide](/guides/supported-formats) for details.

**Q: How often does the connector sync?**
A: The sync frequency depends on your connector schedule configuration and can be set to run at regular intervals or triggered manually.

**Q: Can I use this with Google Docs native format?**
A: The connector works with uploaded files rather than native Google Docs format. Export Google Docs to supported formats like DOCX for translation.

**Q: What happens if someone moves a file while it's being processed?**
A: The connector may encounter errors if files are moved during processing. It's recommended to establish file handling procedures to avoid conflicts.
