## Overview

The Webflow connector enables you to translate and localize your Webflow CMS content through LILT's professional translation services. This collection-based connector focuses on dynamic content stored in Webflow Collections, providing automated workflows for translating website content while maintaining design integrity and functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Webflow connector, ensure you have:

- A Webflow account with CMS access and API permissions
- Collections containing dynamic content ready for translation
- Understanding of Webflow's Collection structure and field types
- Target language Collections already created in Webflow

## Understanding Webflow Localization

### Content Types in Webflow

Webflow content falls into two categories:

1. **Static Content**: Hardcoded into design templates (not processed by the connector)
2. **Dynamic Content**: Stored in Collections databases (processed by the connector)

### Localization Limitations

- Webflow has **no native multilingual solution**
- Collections are language-agnostic by default
- No built-in locale settings or language fields
- Manual setup required for multilingual structure

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Generate Webflow API Key

1. **Access Site Settings**
   - Navigate to your Webflow site
   - Click the ellipsis icon (â‹¯) in the bottom right corner
   - Select **Settings**

2. **Generate API Token**
   - Go to the **Integrations** tab
   - Scroll to the **API access** section
   - Click **Generate New API Token**
   - Copy and securely store the generated token

### Step 2: Identify Source Collections

1. **Find Collection IDs**
   - Navigate to your CMS Collections
   - Click **Settings** next to the collection name
   - Copy the Collection ID displayed at the top

2. **Document Content Structure**
   - Note all translatable fields within each collection
   - Identify field types (text, rich text, etc.)
   - Map content relationships and dependencies

### Step 3: Create Target Language Collections

1. **Duplicate Source Collections**
   - Create a new collection for each target language
   - Use Collection Templates for consistency
   - Click on the source collection template to inherit all fields

2. **Maintain Field Structure**
   - Ensure target collections have **identical field structures**
   - Field names, types, and settings must match exactly
   - Preserve validation rules and requirements

3. **Collect Target Collection IDs**
   - Note the Collection ID for each target language collection
   - These will be mapped to specific languages in LILT

## Collection Structure Requirements

### Field Compatibility

For successful translation, ensure:

- **Identical Field Names**: Source and target collections must have matching field names
- **Matching Field Types**: Text, rich text, and other field types must correspond
- **Validation Rules**: Any field validation must be consistent across collections
- **Required Fields**: Required field settings must match between collections

### Content Format Support

The connector processes content as **JSON+HTML**, supporting:

- **Plain Text Fields**: Basic text content
- **Rich Text Fields**: HTML-formatted content with styling
- **Reference Fields**: Links to other collection items
- **Multi-reference Fields**: Multiple linked items

### Slug Field Considerations

- **Critical Requirement**: Slug fields must follow proper slug formatting
- **Format**: Lowercase, hyphen-separated, no spaces or special characters
- **Impact**: Improper slug format will break the import process
- **Best Practice**: Validate slug formatting before translation

## Translation Workflow

### Content Processing

1. **Content Detection**
   - Connector pulls updated items from source collections
   - Only processes items modified since last sync
   - Extracts translatable content as JSON+HTML

2. **Translation Processing**
   - Content is processed through LILT's translation pipeline
   - Maintains HTML structure and formatting
   - Preserves Webflow-specific field requirements

3. **Content Delivery**
   - Translated content is imported to target collections
   - Field mappings ensure proper placement
   - Validation checks maintain data integrity

### Collection Status Management

- **Status Field**: Collection item status is preserved during translation
- **Publishing**: Translated items maintain original publishing states
- **Workflow**: Integration with Webflow's content workflow stages

## Best Practices

### Content Organization

- Use consistent naming conventions for collections across languages
- Organize collections with clear hierarchies and relationships
- Implement logical field naming that translates well across languages
- Group related content types for efficient batch processing

### Collection Design

- Design fields with translation in mind (avoid hardcoded text)
- Use rich text fields for content requiring formatting preservation
- Implement proper field validation that works across languages
- Consider text expansion when designing field length limits

### Quality Control

- Review translated content in Webflow's CMS preview
- Test all dynamic page rendering with translated content
- Verify collection relationships and references work correctly
- Check slug formatting and URL structure for each language

### Performance Optimization

- Batch related content updates for efficient processing
- Use collection filtering to focus on specific content types
- Monitor API rate limits and collection size constraints
- Optimize collection structure for translation efficiency

## Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Site Management

For multiple Webflow sites:

```yaml
# Site-specific configuration
sites:
  - site_id: "site_1"
    api_key: "api_key_1"
    collections: ["collection_1", "collection_2"]
  - site_id: "site_2"
    api_key: "api_key_2"
    collections: ["collection_3", "collection_4"]
```

### Content Filtering

```yaml
# Filter collections by specific criteria
content_filters:
  - field: "status"
    value: "published"
  - field: "category"
    values: ["blog", "news", "updates"]
```

### Field Mapping

```yaml
# Map fields between source and target collections
field_mapping:
  source_field_name: "target_field_name"
  content_title: "titulo_contenido"
  body_text: "texto_cuerpo"
```
