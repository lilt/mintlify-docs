## Best Practices

### Content Structure

- Organize content types with clear field hierarchies
- Use consistent naming conventions for translatable fields
- Implement proper content modeling for multilingual workflows
- Consider content relationships and references across languages

### Translation Workflow

- Establish clear approval processes for translated content
- Use Contentstack's workflow features to manage translation states
- Coordinate with your LILT Production Strategist for memory setup
- Implement quality control checks before publishing

### Performance Optimization

- Batch related content for efficient translation processing
- Use content filtering to focus on specific content types
- Monitor API rate limits and usage patterns
- Optimize content structure for translation efficiency

### Security and Permissions

- Use environment-specific tokens for different deployment stages
- Implement proper user permissions for translation workflows
- Regularly review and rotate API tokens
- Monitor connector usage and access logs

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Management

Set up different environments for translation workflows:

```yaml
# Development Environment
source_environment: "development"
target_environment: "staging"

# Production Environment
source_environment: "master"
target_environment: "production"
```

### Content Type Filtering

Configure specific content types for translation:
- Focus on high-priority content types first
- Exclude system or technical content from translation
- Use field-level filtering for partial content translation
