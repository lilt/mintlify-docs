## Overview

The OneDrive connector enables you to translate and manage files stored in Microsoft OneDrive through LILT's translation services. Built on the reliable rclone framework with OAuth authentication, this connector provides automated workflows for importing content from OneDrive, processing it through LILT's translation pipeline, and delivering completed translations back to your OneDrive storage.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the OneDrive connector, ensure you have:

- A Microsoft OneDrive account (Business or Personal)
- Admin access to your Azure Active Directory (for business accounts)
- Ability to create Azure application registrations
- Understanding of Microsoft Graph API permissions
- LILT account with connector access enabled

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Azure Application Registration

1. **Navigate to Azure Portal**
   - Go to [Azure application registration](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)
   - Click **New registration**

2. **Configure Application Settings**
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "LILT OneDrive Integration")
   - **Supported account types**: Choose "Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)"
   - **Redirect URI**: 
     - Select **Web** platform
     - Enter exactly: `http://localhost:53682` (must be typed, not copy/pasted)

3. **Record Application Details**
   - After registration, note the **Application (client) ID**
   - Example: `136691f2-ddab-48a5-953f-9308e8b29be2`
   - Save this ID securely for connector configuration

### Step 2: Generate Client Secret

1. **Access Certificates & Secrets**
   - In your Azure application, go to **Manage** → **Certificates & secrets**
   - Click **New client secret**

2. **Create Secret**
   - Provide a description (e.g., "LILT Connector Secret")
   - Set appropriate expiration period (recommend 24 months maximum)
   - Click **Add**

3. **Record Secret Value**
   - Copy the **Value** immediately (this won't be displayed again)
   - Example: `fZ48Q~xxxxxxxxxxxx-xx`
   - Store securely with the client ID

### Step 3: Configure API Permissions

1. **Access API Permissions**
   - Go to **Manage** → **API permissions**
   - Click **Add a permission** → **Microsoft Graph** → **Delegated permissions**

2. **Required Permissions**
   Add these specific permissions:
   - `Files.Read` - Read user files
   - `Files.Read.All` - Read all files that user can access
   - `Files.ReadWrite` - Read and write user files
   - `Files.ReadWrite.All` - Read and write all files that user can access
   - `offline_access` - Maintain access to data you have given it access to
   - `User.Read` - Sign in and read user profile
   - `Sites.Read.All` - Read items in all site collections

3. **Grant Admin Consent**
   - Click **Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]**
   - Confirm consent for all permissions

### Step 4: OAuth Token Generation

#### Using LILT Connector Builder (Recommended)

1. **Access Connector Builder**
   - Navigate to LILT's Connector Builder interface
   - Select **OneDrive** as connector type
   - Follow OAuth authentication flow

2. **Complete OAuth Flow**
   - Enter your Azure application Client ID and Client Secret
   - Authorize access through Microsoft's OAuth flow
   - Connector Builder automatically handles token generation and storage

#### Manual OAuth Process (Advanced)

If using manual setup, follow this OAuth 2.0 flow:

1. **Authorization URL**
   ```
   https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
   client_id={client_id}&
   scope=files.read files.read.all files.readwrite files.readwrite.all offline_access sites.read.all user.read&
   response_type=code&
   redirect_uri=http://localhost:53682
   ```

2. **Token Exchange**
   POST to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/token`:
   ```
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   client_id={client_id}&
   redirect_uri=http://localhost:53682&
   client_secret={client_secret}&
   code={authorization_code}&
   grant_type=authorization_code
   ```

3. **Extract Tokens**
   - Save `refresh_token` for connector configuration
   - `access_token` is used for immediate API access
   - `expires_in` indicates token lifetime

## Translation Workflow

### Automated File Processing

1. **Content Detection**
   - Connector periodically scans configured OneDrive folders
   - Only processes [supported file formats](https://support.lilt.com/kb/supported-file-formats)
   - Automatically creates translation projects for new content

2. **File Import**
   - Source files are imported from OneDrive folders
   - Original file structure and metadata are preserved
   - Content is routed to appropriate translation memory based on language detection

3. **Translation Processing**
   - Content is processed through LILT's translation pipeline
   - File formatting and structure are maintained during translation
   - Progress can be monitored through LILT's project dashboard

4. **Content Delivery**
   - Completed translations are delivered back to designated OneDrive folders
   - Original folder structure is preserved in target location
   - Delivery notifications are sent when translations are complete

### File Organization Best Practices

**Source Folder Structure:**
```
OneDrive/
├── Translation Source/
│   ├── English/
│   │   ├── documents/
│   │   ├── presentations/
│   │   └── spreadsheets/
│   └── staging/
└── Translation Output/
    ├── Spanish/
    ├── French/
    └── German/
```

**Recommended Naming Conventions:**
- Use clear, descriptive folder names
- Organize by language and content type
- Implement version control through folder structure
- Separate source and target content clearly
