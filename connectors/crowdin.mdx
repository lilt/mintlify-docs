## Overview

The Crowdin connector enables you to integrate your Crowdin localization management platform with LILT's professional translation services. This task-based connector leverages Crowdin's robust project management infrastructure to provide automated workflows for translating your software, web, and mobile app content through LILT's AI-powered and human translation services.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Crowdin connector, ensure you have:

- A Crowdin account with project management permissions
- Admin access to invite contributors to your Crowdin projects
- Ability to create and assign tasks within your projects
- Projects with content ready for translation

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Invite LILT as a Project Contributor

1. **Access Project Settings**
   - Navigate to your Crowdin project
   - Go to **Project Settings** → **Members**

2. **Invite LILT Contributor**
   - Click **Invite Members**
   - Enter the LILT contributor email address (provided by your Account Executive)
   - Assign appropriate permissions:
     - **Translator** role (minimum)
     - **Manager** role (recommended for full functionality)
   - Send the invitation

3. **Confirm Access**
   - Wait for LILT to accept the invitation
   - Verify the LILT contributor appears in your project members list

### Step 2: Configure Project Settings

1. **Set Up Languages**
   - Ensure all target languages are configured in your project
   - Verify language codes match LILT's supported locales
   - Configure any custom language mappings if needed

2. **Configure Workflow**
   - Set up translation workflow steps
   - Ensure "Translation" step is properly configured
   - Configure review and approval processes as needed

## Task-Based Translation Workflow

### Creating Translation Tasks

The Crowdin connector operates through Crowdin's task infrastructure. To submit content for translation:

1. **Navigate to Tasks**
   - Go to your Crowdin project
   - Select **Tasks** → **New Task**

2. **Configure Task Settings**
   - Select **Translation** as the **Workflow Step**
   - Choose **Skip strings already included in other tasks** to avoid conflicts
   - Select the content (files, folders, or strings) to translate
   - Choose source and target languages

3. **Assign to LILT**
   - In the assignment section, assign the task to the LILT contributor
   - Assign for each target language as needed
   - Set appropriate deadlines and priorities

4. **Add Task Details**
   - Provide a descriptive **Summary** for tracking
   - Add any special instructions or context
   - Include reference materials if applicable

5. **Create Task**
   - Review all settings
   - Click **Create** to submit the task

### Task Lifecycle Management

**TO DO → IN PROGRESS → DONE**

1. **TO DO**: Newly created tasks appear in the TO DO column
2. **IN PROGRESS**: LILT automatically moves tasks here when processing begins
3. **DONE**: Completed translations are delivered and moved to DONE

### Content Delivery Options

Tasks can be delivered in different approval states:
- **Approved** (default): Translations are marked as approved and ready for use
- **Non-approved**: Translations require additional review before approval

Contact your LILT Production Strategist to configure the preferred delivery state.
